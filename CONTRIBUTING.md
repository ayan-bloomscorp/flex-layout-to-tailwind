## Got a Question ?

If you want to ask a question, we assume you have read the [README]().

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help by submitting an issue. You can also submit a pull request with a fix.

#### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem may already exist and has been resolved.

Fixing all the issues as soon as possible is a goal, but before fixing a bug context needs to be shared to help to reproduce the issue. It saves a lot of time.

A minimal reproduction allows to quickly confirm a bug as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

#### Submitting a Pull Request

- Make sure unit tests pass (`npm test`)
- Make sure build returns no errors (`npm build`)
- Follow the [commit message convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (`type: subject`)

### Want to create a New Feature ?

You can start contributing on an opened issue. For that, fork the project and create a pull request linked to that issue.

If you don't find an Issue for your idea of Feature, before even starting to work on it, open an [Issue](/issues/new). We'll take a look and decide if the feature is needed or not to avoid you to lose time if we don't want to add that kind of feature.

You can use `npm start` to launch the CLI locally. Running `npm test` and `npm build` is mandatory (ie: [Submitting a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request)).
